name: pro-workflow
description: Implement self-correcting memory, parallel worktrees, wrap-up rituals, and review checkpoints for AI coding sessions. Configures CLAUDE.md rules, quality gates, and context management. Use when setting up AI coding best practices, optimising agent workflows, or asking about Claude Code or Cursor productivity patterns.
---

# Pro Workflow

Real-world AI coding patterns from power users who ship production code daily. Not theory - workflows that compound over time.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Cursor, and other AI coding agents. Sections marked *(Claude Code)* use features specific to Claude Code — Cursor users can skip those or use the noted alternatives.

## The Core Insight

> "80% of my code is written by AI, 20% is spent reviewing and correcting it." — Karpathy

This skill optimizes for that ratio. Every pattern here reduces correction cycles.

---

## 1. The Self-Correction Loop

**The single most powerful pattern.** Your CLAUDE.md trains itself through corrections.

### How It Works

When you correct Claude:
1. Claude acknowledges the mistake
2. Proposes a rule to prevent it
3. You approve → rule goes into memory
4. Future sessions avoid the same mistake

### Add to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Self-Correction Protocol

When the user corrects me or I make a mistake:
1. Acknowledge specifically what went wrong
2. Propose a concise rule: `[LEARN] Category: One-line rule`
3. Wait for approval before adding to LEARNED section

### LEARNED
<!-- Auto-populated through corrections -->
```

### Trigger Phrases

- "Add that to your rules"
- "Remember this"
- "Don't do that again"

### Example Flow

```
User: You edited the wrong file
Claude: I edited src/utils.ts when you meant src/lib/utils.ts.

[LEARN] Navigation: Confirm full path before editing files with common names.

Should I add this?
```

---

## 2. Parallel Sessions with Worktrees

**Zero dead time.** While one Claude thinks, work on something else.

### Setup

**Claude Code:**
```bash
claude --worktree    # or claude -w (auto-creates isolated worktree)
```

**Cursor / Any editor:**

```bash
git worktree add ../project-feat feature-branch
git worktree add ../project-fix bugfix-branch
```

### Background Agent Management *(Claude Code)*

- `Ctrl+F` — Kill all background agents (two-press confirmation)
- `Ctrl+B` — Send task to background
- Subagents support `isolation: worktree` in agent frontmatter

### When to Parallelize

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Waiting on tests | Start new feature in worktree |
| Long build | Debug issue in parallel |
| Exploring approaches | Try 2-3 simultaneously |

### Add to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Parallel Work
When blocked on long operations, use `claude -w` for instant parallel sessions.
Subagents with `isolation: worktree` get their own safe working copy.
```

---

## 3. The Wrap-Up Ritual

End sessions with intention. Capture learnings, verify state.

### /wrap-up Checklist

1. **Changes Audit** - List modified files, uncommitted changes
2. **State Check** - Run `git status`, tests, lint
3. **Learning Capture** - What mistakes? What worked?
4. **Next Session** - What's next? Any blockers?
5. **Summary** - One paragraph of what was accomplished

### Create Command

`~/.claude/commands/wrap-up.md`:

```markdown
Execute wrap-up checklist:
1. `git status` - uncommitted changes?
2. `npm test -- --changed` - tests passing?
3. What was learned this session?
4. Propose LEARNED additions
5. One-paragraph summary
```

---

## 4. Split Memory Architecture

For complex projects, modularize Claude memory.

### Structure

```
.claude/
├── CLAUDE.md        # Entry point
├── AGENTS.md        # Workflow rules
├── SOUL.md          # Style preferences
└── LEARNED.md       # Auto-populated
```

### AGENTS.md

```markdown
# Workflow Rules

## Planning
Plan mode when: >3 files, architecture decisions, multiple approaches.

## Quality Gates
Before complete: lint, typecheck, test --related.

## Subagents
Use for: parallel exploration, background tasks.
Avoid for: tasks needing conversation context.
```

### SOUL.md

```markdown
# Style

- Concise over verbose
- Action over explanation
- Acknowledge mistakes directly
- No features beyond scope
```

---

## 5. The 80/20 Review Pattern

Batch reviews at checkpoints, not every change.

### Review Points

1. After plan approval
2. After each milestone
3. Before destructive operations
4. At /wrap-up

### Add to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Review Checkpoints
Pause for review at: plan completion, >5 file edits, git operations, auth/security code.
Between: proceed with confidence.
```

---

## 6. Model Selection

**Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6** both support adaptive thinking and 1M-token context. The 1M context is available as a beta option (via the `context-1m-2025-08-07` beta header); the default context window remains 200K. Sonnet 4.5 (200K context) has been retired from the Max plan in favor of Sonnet 4.6.

| Task | Model |
|------|-------|
| Quick fixes, exploration | Haiku 4.5 |
| Features, balanced work | Sonnet 4.6 |
| Refactors, architecture | Opus 4.6 |
| Hard bugs, multi-system | Opus 4.6 |

### Adaptive Thinking

Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 automatically calibrate reasoning depth per task — lightweight for simple operations, deep analysis for complex problems. No configuration needed. Extended thinking is built-in.

### Add to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Model Hints
Opus 4.6 and Sonnet 4.6 auto-calibrate reasoning depth — no need to toggle thinking mode.
Use subagents with Haiku for fast read-only exploration, Sonnet 4.6 for balanced work.
```

---

## 7. Context Discipline

200k tokens is precious. Manage it.

### Rules

1. Read before edit
2. Compact at task boundaries
3. Disable unused MCPs (<10 enabled, <80 tools)
4. Summarize explorations
5. Use subagents to isolate high-volume output (tests, logs, docs)

### Context Compaction

- Auto-compacts at ~95% capacity (keeps long-running agents alive)
- Configure earlier compaction: `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE=50`
- Use PreCompact hooks to save state before compaction
- Subagents auto-compact independently from the main session

### Good Compact Points

- After planning, before execution
- After completing a feature
- When context >70%
- Before switching task domains

---

## 8. Learning Log

Auto-document insights from sessions.

### Add to CLAUDE.md

```markdown
## Learning Log
After tasks, note learnings:
`[DATE] [TOPIC]: Key insight`

Append to .claude/learning-log.md
```

---

## Learn Claude Code

Run `/learn` for a topic-by-topic guide covering sessions, context, CLAUDE.md, subagents, hooks, and more. Official docs: **https://code.claude.com/docs/**

---

## Quick Setup

### Minimal

Add to your CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Pro Workflow

### Self-Correction
When corrected, propose rule → add to LEARNED after approval.

### Planning
Multi-file: plan first, wait for "proceed".

### Quality
After edits: lint, typecheck, test.

### LEARNED
```

### Full Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohitg00/pro-workflow.git /tmp/pw
cp -r /tmp/pw/templates/split-claude-md/* ./.claude/
cp -r /tmp/pw/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
```

---

## Hooks *(Claude Code)*

Pro-workflow includes automated hooks to enforce the patterns. Cursor users get equivalent enforcement through `.mdc` rules in the `rules/` directory.

### PreToolUse Hooks

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Edit/Write | Track edit count, remind at 5/10 edits |
| git commit | Remind to run quality gates |
| git push | Remind about /wrap-up |

### PostToolUse Hooks

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Code edit (.ts/.js/.py/.go) | Check for console.log, TODOs, secrets |
| Test commands | Suggest [LEARN] from failures |

### Session Hooks

| Hook | Action |
|------|--------|
| SessionStart | Load LEARNED patterns, show worktree count |
| Stop | Context-aware reminders using `last_assistant_message` |
| SessionEnd | Check uncommitted changes, prompt for learnings |
| ConfigChange | Detect when quality gates or hooks are modified mid-session |

### Install Hooks

```bash
# Copy hooks to your settings
cp ~/skills/pro-workflow/hooks/hooks.json ~/.claude/settings.local.json

# Or merge with existing settings
```

### Hook Philosophy

Based on Twitter thread insights:
- **Non-blocking** - Hooks remind, don't block (except dangerous ops)
- **Checkpoint-based** - Quality gates at intervals, not every edit
- **Learning-focused** - Always prompt for pattern capture

---

## Contexts

Switch modes based on what you're doing.

| Context | Trigger | Behavior |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **dev** | "Let's build" | Code first, iterate fast |
| **review** | "Review this" | Read-only, security focus |
| **research** | "Help me understand" | Explore, summarize, plan |

Use: "Switch to dev mode" or load context file.

---

## Agents

Specialized subagents for focused tasks.

| Agent | Purpose | Tools |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **planner** | Break down complex tasks | Read-only |
| **reviewer** | Code review, security audit | Read + test |

### When to Delegate

Use planner agent when:
- Task touches >5 files
- Architecture decision needed
- Requirements unclear

Use reviewer agent when:
- Before committing
- PR reviews
- Security concerns

### Custom Subagents *(Claude Code)*

Create project-specific subagents in `.claude/agents/` or user-wide in `~/.claude/agents/`:
- Define with YAML frontmatter + markdown system prompt
- Control tools, model, permission mode, hooks, and persistent memory
- Use `/agents` to create, edit, and manage interactively
- Preload skills into subagents for domain knowledge

### Agent Teams *(Claude Code, Experimental)*

Coordinate multiple Claude Code sessions as a team:
- Enable: `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
- Lead session coordinates, teammates work independently
- Teammates message each other directly (not just report back)
- Shared task list with dependency management
- Display: in-process (`Shift+Down` to navigate, wraps around) or split panes (tmux/iTerm2)
- Delegate mode (Shift+Tab): lead coordinates only, no code edits
- Best for: parallel reviews, competing hypotheses, cross-layer changes
- **Docs:** https://code.claude.com/docs/agent-teams

---

## MCP Config *(Claude Code)*

Keep <10 MCPs enabled, <80 tools total.

Essential:
- `github` - PRs, issues
- `memory` - Persist learnings
- `filesystem` - File ops

See `mcp-config.example.json` for setup.

---
